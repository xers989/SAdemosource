| | Description |
|--|--|
| `.npmignore` | Ignore files when packaging as `npm` module |
| `components` | Directory _(default)_ where Component implementations are added |
| `main.js` | Entrypoint for the Custom Component Package configuration |
| `Dockerfile` | Configuration file to create docker image |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Configuration file for docker deployment |
| `spec` | Placeholder for unit test implementations |

The Component Package behaves like any other `npm` project. Directly install
any dependencies or tools required to implement the customizations.

## Deployment

As this package is designed to be installed and run with a corresponding service
wrapper, run `npm pack` and upload the resulting `.tgz` as a package for
the _Embedded Container_ service.

```shell
npm pack
# or validate and package with the @oracle/bots-node-sdk command line
npm run bots-node-sdk -- pack .
```
