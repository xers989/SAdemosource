Skills are designed to interact with users and fulfill specific types of tasks, in this demo search ship and delete ship. Each skill helps a user complete a task through a combination of text messages and simple UI elements.   
Now you need to add intents in the skill, click add 2 intents. (Don't change the intent name, it is used in flow definition)    

```text
ChargoShip intent
Conversation Name : ChargoShip
Name : ChargoShip
Utterances :
Can I see ship information
Cargoship information please
Cargoship list, please
I' wondering about the ship information
Show me the ship information
What kind of ship do I have?
```
```text
DeleteCargoShip intent
Conversation Name : DeleteCargoShip
Name : DeleteCargoShip
Utterances :
delete cargoship
Get rid of the ship
I have to delete the cargo ship
This is need to be delete
```

<img src="/images/allegro-bot/image5.png" width="70%" height="70%">       

When user starts conversation with bot, it detects user's intent by Utterances.   
For example, if you types "I wonders about my cargoship list", the bot recognizes your tentant as CargoShip and proceed the conversation.   

After inputing all information, you need to train the skill. Then digital bot can recognize users' intent.

digitalAssistant $ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ allegro-backend-1.0.0.tgz
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ allegrobackend.js
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ deleteCargoShip.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ getCargoShip.js
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
